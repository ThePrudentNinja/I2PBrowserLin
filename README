Project Homepage: None
Project Github: https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PBrowserLin

This is simply a portable modified Tor browser for use with I2P for Linux.

The Windows version is here:
https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PBrowserWin

The suite for Linux (that contains this browser) is here:
https://github.com/ThePrudentNinja/I2PPortableLin

To obtain this browser, download the following archive and extract.
Then chmod +x the fix-permissions.sh file and run it.
Then launch the browser by clicking on the I2PBrowser.desktop file.

Downloading in the browser currently doesn't work. This is a known issue. If you want to
download stuff from eepsites, please use the eepget script that comes with I2P.
The Linux suite has this script under App/I2P/ (eepget, not eepgetbrowser)
